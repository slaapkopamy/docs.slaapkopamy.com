If it's your first time playing Multiplayer or first time on 1.17.1 Multiplayer then you need to first accept a message that Microsoft don't take any responsibility about the damage that can be done in Online multiplayer games. So it's your own risk. But simply you can accept the message and go on.

You now need to press on "Add server" down below around the right corner in your screen.

Now you are in the Add server screen and the server name is optional so you don't need to fill it in. If you want categorize your servers then you can fill it in with "**Peeplings SMP**".\
For the server address you need to fill in for sure and that is with our server address named **play.peeplings.net** No port needed. And when you are done you can press on "Done".
