# Claiming land

## Introduction

Welcome by the introduction of claiming land.

You probably already know that most Survival multiplayer servers have a land claim option to claim your builds or bases. And we have that too, but ours is a bit complicated for a lot of people. So under this category you can find all sort of questions with like how can I create land. or how can I claim the land. Do I need to pay upkeep? In how many days the claim gets deleted by inactivity and much more.

Claiming land is a big subject for the server because if you don't claim your builds then people can grief you. They will grief you for sure, yes we have the tools to see who did it and we can rollback stuff but that is for us too much work to do that by 20+ players regularly. We can use that time for different things.

If you think hey there is missing some information in the wiki, then you can message SlaapkopAmy in the Discord server about it. She will make sure it will get added and can answer the question for you.
