# Contribution

## Introduction

We had in the past people asking to us hey can I help with paying the server, or Hey can I donate money? And a lot of other ways asking to help out and we said back then always no because we know hey you want to get something back from it. So here is a dedicated page how you can contribute to the Peeplings SMP

### Playing the server

One and the best contribution to the server is just playing the server and be online, have fun with the community and soon you can also vote for the server. The only cost is your free time no money is involved.

## I want to donate money!

If you really really want to donate money to us then we have some options for you, none of the options has free rewards or special treatment inside the Peeplings SMP and it's not refundable so keep in mind it's a donation and you don't buy anything for the server.

### Subscribe to NineteenPeep on Twitch

If you want to give financially support to NineteenPeep then the best option is subscribing on her page on Twitch [https://twitch.tv/nineteenpeep](https://twitch.tv/nineteenpeep). You get from that the Twitch rewards so you can use her emotes over whole Twitch.

## But I want really support the server with money!

Okay If you really want to support the server with your money then keep in mind the money will be also used for private projects like hosting private stuff of SlaapkopAmy (Websites / e-mails / cloud / Discord bots / Twitch bots / game servers / etc...), So if you really want to do that then here are some options, some of them has rewards (not on the Peeplings SMP) and some of them are a win-win situation.

### Subscribe to SlaapkopAmy on Twitch

One of the options is subscribing to SlaapkopAmy on Twitch she doesn't stream that often but you can get Twitch wide rewards like emotes to use. [https://twitch.tv/slaapkopamy](https://twitch.tv/slaapkopamy)

You are probably wondering if it's possible to Donate via PayPal, and yes that is possible. Just go to [https://paypal.me/amydev](https://paypal.me/amydev) and via there you can donate money. Keep in mind we don't do refunds because it's a donation and you don't buy anything from us.

### Using Honeygain app

This is a win-win situation for both of us, with Honeygain you can share your bandwidth with the company to gain credits. Per 1000 credits is $1 USD to able get 1$ you need to share 10gb data. A payout is possible at $20 USD so at 200GB shared bandwidth.

If you using the referral of SlaapkopAmy (Who pays the server) then she gets 10% lifetime bonus of your earned credits, you don't loose any credits if you keep sharing your bandwidth.

Is it safe? They claim it is safe to use but keep in mind it looks very sketchy and we will never know where they have access to with your data. Using the app is a win-win situation for both of us because we both get paid so see it as free money. Your CPU, GPU, RAM will be fine at using it. If you are a content creator (streamer) you can use the app at the same time without loosing quality of your streams.

_Keep in mind they don't have an android app in the google play store because google thinks its fraud but also google is keeping all the fake apps in their store.
